Assume that you are asked to add a run method to all Animals in the example in Problem 2 above.
Which approach - inheritance or dependency inversion with injection
would be easier for you to extend with the new functionality?
Justify your answer by discussing what you would need to to in each case.
You do not need to write code for this question.

Answer:
It would be easier to use inheritance in this case because the implementation
of the run method will not change. Also, since the method is being applied 
to all Animals, it infers that it means the Animal class. By making a virtual
run method in the Animal class, the other classes can use this to accomplish 
the run task since they inherit from the Animal class. This will be easier to accomplish 
because everything else already uses the inheritance so the run method simply needs
to be called for the individual animals to work instead of creating a whole new 
interface to use the dependency inversion.
