Design: 

Our design followed the prompt, in that we tried our best to create a system that handled the tasks given for the project. Implementing the areas of concern, including user interacting, wav processing, and File I/o all posed their own challenges. We made sure that code handling one aspect did not have any code relating to another area of concern, which helped modulate the processs. 

Challenges: In my opinion the biggest challenge for our group was communication and lack of planning. We planned to divide and delegate the work for 3 group members, however we could not get in contact with the third member for many days, which wasted a lot of time.
