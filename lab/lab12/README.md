# CS202-Lab12

## Lab Goals
The goal of this Lab is to:
1.	Allow students to modify a program to use **recursion**.
## Program

A .cpp file has been provided to time the execution time of two functions which compute factorials. The iterative function is provided for you. Your task is to implement the recursive function for calculating factorials. 

Once you correctly implement the function, increase the TERM to 20 and run the program 10 times. Plot the 10 average times the program computes (Excel spreadsheets are fine) and write a couple sentence summary of your findings.  

## What to Turn In

Turn in your Github clone URL for grading.

## Academic Honesty
Academic dishonesty is against university as well as the system community standards. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Plagiarism: defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts or work of another as one's own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion.
Cheating: defined as (1) obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and other materials; (2) obtaining or providing information concerning all or part of an examination prior to that examination; (3) taking an examination for another student, or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place; (4) altering or changing test answers after submittal for grading, grades after grades have been awarded, or other academic records once these are official.
Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitute academic
dishonesty according to the code of this university. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and
penalties can include cancelling a studentâ€™s enrolment without a grade, giving an F for the course, or for the assignment. For more details, see the University of Nevada, Reno General Catalog.
