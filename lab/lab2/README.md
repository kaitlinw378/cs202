## makefiles

This lab is designed to help you create your first makefile.

This repository contains the main driver `analyzer.cpp`, 
an empty source file called `stat_finder.cpp`, and an empty header file called `stat_finder.h`
for a project. 
Your task is to pull the functions out of the main driver and 
put them into the appropriate source or header files and to create a makefile
which compiles all the necessary pieces into an executable called `analyzer`. 
That makefile should be uploaded to your repository when you're done, 
along with your changes to the other 3 files.
